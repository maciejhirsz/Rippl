# Rippl

* * *

Rippl is a <canvas> library that's focused on performance and ease of use. Written completely in CoffeeScript, it can be used in both CoffeeScript or pure JavaScript projects alike. Rippl is built with AMD support if you want to use it with RequireJS. Rippl is entirely agnostic regarding how you structure your application â€” it will stay out of your way and be there for you when you need it.
